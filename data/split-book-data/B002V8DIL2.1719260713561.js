window.bookSummaryJSON = "In the year of our Lord 1141, civil war over England's throne leaves a legacy of violence, and the murder of a knight dear to Brother Cadfael. And with the gentle bud-strewn May, a flood of pilgrims comes to the celebration of Saint Winifred at the Abbey of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, carrying with it many strange souls, and perhaps the knight's killer. <p> Brother Cadfael's shrewd eyes see all: the prosperous merchant who rings false, an angelic lame boy, his beautiful dowerless sister, and two wealthy penitents.</p>";
