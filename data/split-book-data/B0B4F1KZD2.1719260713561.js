window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A provocative collection of literary horror stories by one of America’s most acclaimed and inventive writers whose unique prose “can be soul-shaking” (<i>New Yorker</i>).</p> <p>“Preoccupied with the uncanny, the unsettling, and the unknowable” (<i>The Los Angeles Review</i>), Evenson’s seventeen stories in this collection “evoke Kafka, some Poe, some Beckett, some Roald Dahl, and . . . Stephen King” (<i>The New York Times Sunday Book Review</i>).</p> <p>Whether it’s a stuffed bear’s heart that beats with the rhythm of a dead baby, or the city of Reno that keeps receding to the east no matter how far you drive, or a mine on another planet where the dust won’t stop seeping in, the astonishing stories in<i> A Collapse of Horses</i> range from horror to science fiction to noir and all the weird, edgy places in between. Wherever Evenson takes you in his minimalist horror, he “doesn’t shy away from blood, murder, apparitions, surrealism, dreams, torture, and weirdness, but he also refrains from letting those elements take over” (<i>Electric Lit</i>).</p>";
