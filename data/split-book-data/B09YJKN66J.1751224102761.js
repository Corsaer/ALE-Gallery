window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Four-time Hugo Award-winning and </b><b><i>New York Times</i></b><b> bestselling author N.K. Jemisin crafts a glorious tale of identity, resistance, magic and myth.</b></p> <p>All is not well in the city that never sleeps. Even though the avatars of New York City have temporarily managed to stop the Woman in White from invading—and destroying the entire universe in the process—the mysterious capital \"E\" Enemy has more subtle powers at her disposal. A new candidate for mayor wielding the populist rhetoric of gentrification, xenophobia, and \"law and order\" may have what it takes to change the very nature of New York itself and take it down from the inside.</p> <p>In order to defeat him, and the Enemy who holds his purse strings, the avatars will have to join together with the other Great Cities of the world in order to bring her down for good and protect their world from complete destruction.</p> <p>N.K. Jemisin’s Great Cities Duology, which began with <i>The City We Became</i> and concludes with <i>The World We Make</i>, is a masterpiece of speculative fiction from one of the most important writers of her generation.</p> <p><b>The Great Cities Duology</b></p> <p><i>The City We Became</i></p> <p><i>The World We Make</i></p>";
