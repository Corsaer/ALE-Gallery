window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>An Orks Novel</p> <p>Witness a battle royale between feuding ork bosses in a fight for the position of Warboss – and access to a legendary gate that will help the orks conquer the galaxy.</p> <p>LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE</p> <p>It’s a raucous and bloody boyz-eye-view of a war for succession between six clans, told with typically orky flair by Mike Brooks.</p> <p>THE STORY</p> <p>With only one bastion still standing on the once unconquerable fortress world of Aranua, Warboss Gazrot Goresnappa should be basking in the light of impending victory. Instead, he lies ‘proppa dead’ beneath a decapitated Gargant’s head.</p> <p>The biggest and baddest bosses from each of the six (no-longer-united) clans step forward to duke it out to become the next warboss – but the ork gods have other plans. A prophecy foretells of a mysterious gate that lies beneath the human city. The one true warboss will be the first to find it, and will use it to turn the galaxy green. Da Genrul of the Blood Axes knows only he is worthy, but it seems Evil Sunz Speedboss Zagnob and Goff Big Boss Mag Dedfist didn’t get the memo. And to add insult to injury, nor did the leader of the grot uprising, the one true prophet of Gork and Mork (or so he claims), Snaggi Littletoof, who seeks to use this opportunity to turn the tide of grot oppression.</p> <p>Who will the green gods deem worthy?</p>";
