window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b><i>New York Times </i></b><b>Best Seller</b></p> <p><b>From the author of </b><b><i>Uprooted</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Spinning Silver</i></b><b> comes the first book of the Scholomance trilogy, the story of an unwilling dark sorceress who is destined to rewrite the rules of magic.</b></p> <p><b>Finalist for the Lodestar Award</b></p> <p><b>“The dark school of magic I’ve been waiting for.” (Katherine Arden, author of the Winternight Trilogy)</b> </p> <p>I decided that Orion Lake needed to die after the second time he saved my life. </p> <p>Everyone loves Orion Lake. Everyone <i>else,</i> that is. Far as I’m concerned, he can keep his flashy combat magic to himself. I’m not joining his pack of adoring fans. </p> <p>I don’t need help surviving the Scholomance, even if they do. Forget the hordes of monsters and cursed artifacts; I’m probably the most dangerous thing in the place. Just give me a chance and I’ll level mountains and kill untold millions, making myself the dark queen of the world. </p> <p>At least, that’s what the world expects. Most of the other students in here would be delighted if Orion killed me, like one more evil thing that’s crawled out of the drains. Sometimes I think they want me to turn into the evil witch they assume I am. The school certainly does. </p> <p>But the Scholomance isn’t getting what it wants from me. And neither is Orion Lake.

Novik puts a refreshingly dark, adult spin on the magical boarding school. ... Readers will delight in the push-and-pull of El and Orion’s relationship, the fantastically detailed world, the clever magic system, and the matter-of-fact diversity of the student body.” (<i>Publishers Weekly, </i>starred review)</p>";
