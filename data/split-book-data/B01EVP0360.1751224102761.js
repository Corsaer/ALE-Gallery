window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Philip K. Dick (1928-1982) was one of the seminal figures of 20th century science fiction. His many stories and novels, which include such classics as <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> and <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>, reflect a deeply personal worldview, exploring the fragile, multifarious nature of reality itself and examining those elements that make us - or fail to make us - fully human. He did as much as anyone to demolish the artificial barrier between genre fiction and literature, and the best of his work has earned a permanent place in American popular culture. </p> <p><i>Upon the Dull Earth</i> is the third installment of a uniform, five-volume edition of The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick. This generous collection contains 22 stories and novellas written in 1953 and 1954, along with extensive - and valuable - story notes. Included here are a number of bona fide PKD classics, among them the title story, the brilliantly conceived account of a bizarre, ultimately catastrophic resurrection, \"The Father-Thing,\" in which a young boy comes to realize that his once familiar father has somehow changed, and <i>The Golden Man</i> (filmed in 2007 as <i>Next</i>), which tells the tale of a golden skinned mutant who may represent the future direction of the human race. These and all the other stories in this important and necessary audiobook offer a wide range of literary and intellectual pleasures. At the same time, they provide a fascinating glimpse into the continuing development of this iconic - and hugely influential - figure. </p>";
