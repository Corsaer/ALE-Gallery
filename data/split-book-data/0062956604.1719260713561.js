Told in a series of eerie flashbacks, the story of The Faceless Old Woman goes back centuries to reveal an initially blissful and then tragic childhood on a Mediterranean Estate in the early 19th century, her rise in the criminal underworld of Europe, a nautical adventure with a mysterious organization of smugglers, her plot for revenge on the ones who betrayed her, and ultimately her death and its aftermath, as her spirit travels the world for decades until settling in modern-day Night Vale.</p> <p>Interspersed throughout is a present-day story in Night Vale, as The Faceless Old Woman guides, haunts, and sabotages a man named Craig. In the end, her current day dealings with Craig and her swashbuckling history in 19th century Europe will come together in the most unexpected and horrifying way. </p> <p>Part <i>The Haunting of Hill House</i>, part <i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>, and 100 percent about a faceless old woman who secretly lives in your home.</p>";
