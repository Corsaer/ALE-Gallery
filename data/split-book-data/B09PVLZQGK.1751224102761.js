window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book seven of the Ciaphas Cain series</p> <p>Legendary Commissar Ciaphas Cain joins a group of Reclamators Space Marines aboard a space hulk but soon finds himself alone and faced with both tyranids and orks....</p> <p><b>Listen to it because: </b>it's a typically sideways look at the mighty Adeptus Astartes (albeit a pretty unusual chapter), viewing them through the eyes of the wry and dry Commissar Cain.</p> <p><b>The story: </b>Commissar Cain is called to duty once more, saving a governor's daughter from a planet overrun by rebels. The uprising hides something far more sinister however - genestealer hybrids! The search for the source of the alien threat leads Cain to a drifting space hulk - a far safer place than beside the obsessed governor's daughter. But when the Reclamator Space Marines suffer devastating losses at the hands of the Great Devourer, Cain and his trusty aide Jurgen must go it alone. With the tyranids waking and a group of stow away orks on the loose, there are no safe places to run or hide, and Cain must use all his ingenuity and cunning to escape the space hulk alive.</p> <p>Written by Sandy Mitchell. Narrated by Helen McAlpine, Stephen Perring, Penelope Rawlins and Andrew James Spooner.</p>";
