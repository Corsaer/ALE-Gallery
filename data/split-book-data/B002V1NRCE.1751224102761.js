window.bookSummaryJSON = "Neil Gaiman Presents: the third book in Fritz Leiber's classic sword-and-sorcery series. <p>In <i>Swords in the Mist</i>, lean times in Lankhmar force brothers-in-arms Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser to part ways. Only after a joust of wits and swords do the friends join together again, stealing the ship the <i>Black Treasurer</i> and sailing round and through The Claws. Fighting sea kings, curses and seven-eyed wizards, the pair set out on their heroic wanderings through the wilds of Nehwon.</p> <p>The late Fritz Leiber's tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser launched the sword-and-sorcery genre, and were the inspiration for the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons.</p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: Includes an exclusive introduction by Neil Gaiman.</b></p>";
