window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Brilliant, haunting, breathtakingly suspenseful, <i>Night Film</i> is a superb literary thriller by the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of the \"blockbuster debut\" (<i>People</i>) <i>Special Topics in Calamity Physics.</i> </p> <p>On a damp October night, beautiful young Ashley Cordova is found dead in an abandoned warehouse in lower Manhattan. Though her death is ruled a suicide, veteran investigative journalist Scott McGrath suspects otherwise. As he probes the strange circumstances surrounding Ashley’s life and death, McGrath comes face-to-face with the legacy of her father: the legendary, reclusive, cult-horror-film director Stanislas Cordova - a man who hasn’t been seen in public for more than 30 years. </p> <p>For McGrath, another death connected to this seemingly cursed family dynasty seems more than just a coincidence. Though much has been written about Cordova’s dark and unsettling films, very little is known about the man himself. </p> <p>Driven by revenge, curiosity, and a need for the truth, McGrath, with the aid of two strangers, is drawn deeper and deeper into Cordova’s eerie, hypnotic world. </p> <p>The last time he got close to exposing the director, McGrath lost his marriage and his career. This time he might lose even more. </p> <p><i>Night Film,</i> the gorgeously written, spellbinding new novel by the dazzlingly inventive Marisha Pessl, will hold you in suspense to the final minute. </p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b> </p>";
