window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Ben and Marian Rolfe are desperate to escape a stifling summer in their tiny Brooklyn apartment, so when they get the chance to rent a mansion in Upstate New York for the entire summer for only $900, it’s an offer that’s too good to refuse. There’s only one catch: Behind a strange and intricately carved door in a distant wing of the house lives elderly Mrs. Allardyce, and the Rolfes will be responsible for preparing her meals. <br> <br> But Mrs. Allardyce never seems to emerge from her room, and it soon becomes clear that something weird and terrifying is happening in the house. As the suspense builds toward a revelation of what really lies behind that locked door, the Rolfes will discover that their cheap vacation rental comes at a terrible cost.... <br> <br> The basis for a classic 1976 film adaptation and an acknowledged influence on Stephen King’s <i>The Shining</i>, <i>Burnt Offerings</i> is one of the most original and scariest haunted house novels ever written. This edition, the first in decades, features a new introduction by award-winning author Stephen Graham Jones. <br> <br> “<i>Burnt Offerings</i> has no peer. Better than <i>Rosemary’s Baby</i>, <i>The Other</i>, and <i>The Exorcist</i>.” (<i>Hartford Courant</i>)<br> <br> “Insidiously frightening.... It snares you early and draws you inexorably to one of the most nerve-shattering finales in years.” (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br> <br> “Just pick a quiet place and an uninterrupted time to read this novel. You’ll be inclined to jump at sudden noises or even hurl the book at intruders.” (<i>Chicago Tribune</i>)</p>";
