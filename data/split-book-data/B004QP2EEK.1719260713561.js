window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In his novels, best-selling author Cormac McCarthy creates a western landscape filled with characters that are both mythic and authentic. <i>Cities of the Plain</i>, the stunning conclusion of his award-winning Border trilogy, brings together John Grady Cole and Billy Parham—the two lifelong friends who began their adventures in <i>All the Pretty Horses</i>. It is 1952. As Grady and Billy work a remote New Mexico ranch, Grady falls in love with a young Mexican prostitute. Determined to free her from her owner, Grady embarks on his dangerous quest of the heart. Billy tries to protect and help him, but the forces at work soon demand sacrifices greater than either can control. Capturing visions of the American West during its last decades, McCarthy’s powerful work is destined to leave a permanent mark on contemporary literature.</p>";
