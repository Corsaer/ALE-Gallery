window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A Necrons audio.</p> <p>Trazyn the Infinite and Orikan the Diviner are opposites. Each is obsessed with their own speciality and their rivalry spans a millennia. Yet together, they may hold the secret to saving the necron race....</p> <p><b>Listen to it because: </b>explore a story told across the millennia that delves deep into a pair of fascinating necron characters, their relationship and their plans for the galaxy.</p> <p><b>The story: </b>before the being called the Emperor revealed himself, before the rise of the aeldari, before the necrontyr traded their flesh for immortal metal, the world was born in violence. Even when they inhabited bodies of flesh, Trazyn the Infinite and Orikan the Diviner were polar opposites. Trazyn, a collector of historical oddities, presides over a gallery full of the most dangerous artefacts - and people - of the galactic past. Orikan, a chronomancer without peer, draws zodiacs that predict and manipulate the future. But when an artefact emerges that may hold the key to the necronsâ€™ next evolution, these two obsessives enter a multi-millennia game of cat and mouse that ends civilisations, reshapes timelines, and changes both forever. As riddles unwind and ancient secrets are revealed, the question remains: will their feud save the necron race or destroy it?</p> <p>Written by Robert Rath. Narrated by Richard Reed.</p>";
