The consolation prize was an authenticspace suit, and when scientifically minded high school senior Kip Russell wonit, he knew for certain he would use it one day to make a sojourn of his own tothe stars. But \"one day\" comes sooner than he thinks when he tries the suit on in his backyard - and finds himself worlds away, a prisoner aboard a space pirate's ship. The whole thing seems like a bad dream until he discovers he's not theonly prisoner on board. Kip - along with the daughter of a world-renownedscientist and a beautiful creature from another planet - has been kidnapped by amonstrous extraterrestrial, and they are heading straight for what could be Kip's final destination. </p>";
