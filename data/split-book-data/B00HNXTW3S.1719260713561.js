window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>Featuring \"All You Zombies\", the basis for the movie </i>Predestination </p> <p>This collection from grand master Robert A. Heinlein includes five short stories sure to please science fiction fans everywhere. The title story tells the tale of a young man who meets a time-traveling bartender whose origins - and relation to the young man - are more complex and stranger than the Ouroboros ring on the barkeep's finger. In <i>The Man Who Traveled in Elephants</i> - one of both Heinlein and Spider Robinson's all-time favorite stories - we join a former traveling salesman on a bus. The man and his wife had once traveled with a host of imaginary animals searching for places to sell elephants. </p> <p>\"They\" takes listeners inside a mental institution, where a man suffering from delusions has been confined. In \"Our Fair City\", a parking attendant named Pappy, a sentient whirlwind named Kitten, and a crusading reporter named Pete aim to take down their corrupt city government. Lastly, in \"And He Built a Crooked House\", a clever architect designs a house in the shape of the shadow of a tesseract, but it collapses through the fourth dimension when an earthquake shakes it into a more stable form.</p>";
