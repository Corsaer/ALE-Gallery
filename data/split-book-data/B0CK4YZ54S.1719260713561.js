window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A chilling twist on the “cursed film” genre from the bestselling author of </b><b><i>The Pallbearers Club</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>The Cabin at the End of the World.</i></b></p> <p>In June 1993, a group of young guerilla filmmakers spent four weeks making<b> </b><i>Horror Movie,</i> a notorious, disturbing art-house horror flick.</p> <p>The weird part? Only three of the film’s scenes were ever released to the public, but <i>Horror Movie</i> has nevertheless grown a rabid fanbase. Three decades later, Hollywood is pushing for a big budget reboot.</p> <p>The man who played “The Thin Kid” is the only surviving cast member. He remembers all too well the secrets buried within the original screenplay, the bizarre events of the filming, and the dangerous crossed lines on set that resulted in tragedy. As memories flood back in, the boundaries between reality and film, past and present start to blur. But he’s going to help remake the film, even if it means navigating a world of cynical producers, egomaniacal directors, and surreal fan conventions—<i>demons</i> of the past be damned.</p> <p>But at what cost?</p> <p><i>Horror Movie</i> is an obsessive, psychologically chilling, and suspenseful feat of storytelling genius that builds inexorably to an unforgettable, mind-bending conclusion.</p>";
