They made it through the worst night of their lives...but what happens after?</b></p> <p>Like his best-selling novel <i>The Southern Book Club’s Guide to Slaying Vampires,</i> Grady Hendrix’s latest is a fast-paced, frightening, and wickedly humorous thriller. From chain saws to summer camp slayers, <i>The Final Girl Support Group</i> pays tribute to and slyly subverts our most popular horror films - movies like <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, <i>A Nightmare on Elm Street</i>, and <i>Scream.</i></p> <p>Lynnette Tarkington is a real-life final girl who survived a massacre. For more than a decade, she’s been meeting with five other final girls and their therapist in a support group for those who survived the unthinkable, working to put their lives back together. Then one woman misses a meeting, and their worst fears are realized - someone knows about the group and is determined to rip their lives apart again, piece by piece.</p> <p>But the thing about final girls is that no matter how bad the odds, how dark the night, how sharp the knife, they will never, ever give up.</p>";
