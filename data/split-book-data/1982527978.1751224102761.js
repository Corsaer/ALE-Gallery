window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In this hard-rocking, spine-tingling supernatural thriller, the washed-up guitarist of a '90s heavy metal band embarks on an epic road trip across America and deep into the web of a sinister conspiracy.</p> <p>Grady Hendrix, horror writer and author of <i>Paperbacks from Hell</i> and <i>My Best Friend's Exorcism</i>, is back with his most electrifying novel yet. In the 1990s, heavy metal band Durt Wurk was poised for breakout success - but then lead singer Terry Hunt embarked on a solo career and rocketed to stardom as Koffin, leaving his fellow bandmates to rot in obscurity. </p> <p>Two decades later, former guitarist Kris Pulaski works as the night manager of a Best Western - she's tired, broke, and unhappy. Everything changes when a shocking act of violence turns her life upside down, and she begins to suspect that Terry sabotaged more than just the band. </p> <p>Kris hits the road, hoping to reunite with the rest of her bandmates and confront the man who ruined her life. It's a journey that will take her from the Pennsylvania rust belt to a celebrity rehab center to a music festival from hell. A furious power ballad about never giving up, even in the face of overwhelming odds, <i>We Sold Our Souls</i> is an epic journey into the heart of a conspiracy-crazed, pill-popping, paranoid country that seems to have lost its very soul...where only a lone girl with a guitar can save us all.</p>";
