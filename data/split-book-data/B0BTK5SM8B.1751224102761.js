Two freedom riders take a bus ride that leaves them stranded on a lonely road in Alabama where several unsettling <i>somethings</i> await them. A young girl dives into the depths of the Earth in search of the demon that killed her parents. These are just a few of the worlds of <i>Out There Screaming</i>, Jordan Peele’s anthology of all-new horror stories by Black writers. Featuring an introduction by Peele and an all-star roster of beloved writers and new voices, <i>Out There Screaming </i>is a master class in horror, and—like his spine-chilling films—its stories prey on everything we think we know about our world . . . and redefine what it means to be afraid.<br> <br> Featuring stories by: Erin E. Adams, Violet Allen, Lesley Nneka Arimah, Maurice Broaddus, Chesya Burke, P. Djèlí Clark, Ezra Claytan Daniels, Tananarive Due, Nalo Hopkinson, N. K. Jemisin, Justin C. Key, L. D.
