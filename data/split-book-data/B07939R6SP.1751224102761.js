window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>The basis for the Peacock TV series Teacup: An extraterrestrial bounty hunter turns a Southern community into its private hunting ground in “the ultimate horror novel” </b><b><i>(The Philadelphia Inquirer) </i></b><b>.</b></p> <p>The West Texas desert towns of Inferno and Bordertown have been slowly dying. The Snake River isn’t the only thing that divides them. Racism and gang wars have turned the sun-scorched flatlands into a powder keg. If anything can unite them now, it’s the UFO that comes crashing through the clouds.</p> <p>It brings with it a young alien named Daufin, a fugitive who has taken human form. She knows the terror that awaits this planet—because it’s looking for her. Stinger is an alien bounty hunter with an infinite capacity for death and a devious plan to find Daufin. Entombing the region in an inescapable dome, Stinger unleashes a violent fury unknown to humankind. Now, the few remaining survivors must come together to protect Daufin, themselves, and the world beyond.</p> <p>From Robert McCammon, the <i>New York Times</i>–bestselling and Bram Stoker Award–winning author, <i>Stinger </i>is “one of the best suspense novels of recent years” <i>(Science Fiction Chronicle)</i>. It has now been adapted into one of the most hotly anticipated horror series on television: <i>Teacup</i>, premiering on Peacock this October.</p>";
