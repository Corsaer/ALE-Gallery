window.bookSummaryJSON = "Neil Gaiman Presents: the fifth book in Fritz Leiber's classic sword-and-sorcery series. <p>In <i>The Swords of Lankhmar</i>, a plague of rats overruns the capital city and glittering gem of the land of Nehwon. Commissioned to guard a ship of grain from the cursed rodents, brother-in-arms Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser soon discover the plague has progressed to a fatal point. Mustering the strength of sorcery, they descend into the depths of Lankhmar and rise to battle in order to save the soul of the ill-fated city.</p> <p>The late Fritz Leiber's tales of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser launched the sword-and-sorcery genre, and were the inspiration for the fantasy role-playing game Dungeons and Dragons.</p> <p><b>BONUS AUDIO: In a wonderfully written essay, Neil Gaiman says, \"<i>The Swords of Lankhmar</i> glitters and shimmers and dances\", and Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are \"the finest rogues you will ever meet\".</b></p>";
