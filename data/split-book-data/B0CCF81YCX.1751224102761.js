window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book 11 in the Ciaphas Cain Series</p> <p>Ciaphas Cain is nearing retirement, but of course his fate leads him into a twisted web of deception, corruption, and an unfortunate amount of mortal peril. This time, it’s the Adeptus Mechanicus throwing spanners into his future plans of heroic rest and relaxation.</p> <p>LISTEN TO IT BECAUSE</p> <p>The darkly hilarious saga of a reluctant hero continues – packed with all the action, wit, and hijinks you’ve come to expect from Ciaphas and his comrades.</p> <p>THE STORY</p> <p>When the flow of desperately needed weapons for the Astra Militarum slows to nothing from a newly founded forge world, there’s only one man able and (un)willing to investigate… Ciaphas Cain, Hero of the Imperium.</p> <p>With Cain’s desperately sought-after retirement on the line, the Imperium’s most reluctant commissar must navigate insidious assassination attempts against his person, legions of mutinous skitarii, heresy within the upper echelons of the Adeptus Mechanicus itself… and a hidden foe, pulling the strings, with an agenda that could threaten the future of Imperial rule in the Damocles Gulf.</p> <p>Written by Sandy Mitchell. Narrated by Stephen Perring, Penelope Rawlins, Christopher Tester and Andrew James Spooner. Running time 8 hours and 36 minutes (approx).</p>";
