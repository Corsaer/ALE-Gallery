window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A Carcharodons audiobook. </p> <p>With a millennia-long hunt close to its end, Carcharodons Chaplain Manu must redouble his efforts as he ventures into the nightmare city of Commorragh.</p> <p><b>Listen to it because: </b>this is your chance to learn more about the secretive savages of the Carcharodons Astra as they tangle with some of the most terrifying predators in the galaxy...almost as terrifying as themselves.</p> <p><b>The story: </b>in the darkness beyond the galaxy, there are monsters. Some swim closer to the light, drawn by the beacon that is the Astronomican, while others stalk the Void, predators in the dark. The Carcharodons have hunted for millennia, but now they are drawn into a new blackness...the Dark City of the drukhari itself. Commorragh. </p> <p>For a thousand years, Chaplain Tangata Manu has searched for a relic lost under his watch - an ancient thing, once charged into the keeping of the Forgotten One himself. But at the brink of seeing his hunt fulfilled and the relic returned, it is stolen from under him. Now, if Tangata would see his honour restored, he must lead his hunt against some of the vilest predators the galaxy has ever seen, before they can turn the artefact to their own purposes.... </p> <p>Written by Edoardo Albert. Narrated by Gareth Armstrong.</p>";
