window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>John Langan has, in the last few years, established himself as one of the leading voices in contemporary horror literature. Gifted with a supple and mellifluous prose style, an imagination that can conjure up clutching terrors with seeming effortlessness, and a thorough knowledge of the rich heritage of weird fiction, Langan has already garnered his share of accolades.</p> <p>This new collection of nine substantial stories includes such masterworks as \"Technicolor\", an ingenious riff on Poe's \"Masque of the Red Death\"; \"How the Day Runs Down\", a gripping tale of the undead; and \"The Shallows\", a powerful tale of the Cthulhu mythos. The capstone to the collection is a previously unpublished novella of supernatural terror, \"Mother of Stone\".</p>";
