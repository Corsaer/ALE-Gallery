window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><i>The Illustrated Man</i>, a seminal work in Ray Bradbury's career, whose extraordinary power and imagination remain undimmed by time's passage.... </p> <p>Ray Bradbury brings wonders alive. For this peerless American storyteller, the most bewitching force in the universe is human nature. In these 18 startling tales unfolding across a canvas of tattooed skin, living cities take their vengeance, technology awakens the most primal natural instincts, and dreams are carried aloft in junkyard rockets. Provocative and powerful, <i>The Illustrated Man </i>is a kaleidoscopic blending of magic, imagination, and truth - as exhilarating as interplanetary travel, as maddening as a walk in a million-year rain, and as comforting as simple, familiar rituals on the last night of the world. </p>";
