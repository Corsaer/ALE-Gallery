window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>No light. No air. No escape.</b></p> <p>Hundreds of feet beneath the ocean's surface, a graveyard waits. Years ago, the SS Arcadia vanished without a trace during a routine voyage. Though a strange, garbled emergency message was broadcast, neither the ship nor any of its crew could be found. Sixty years later, its wreck has finally been discovered more than three hundred miles from its intended course: a silent graveyard deep beneath the ocean's surface, eagerly waiting for the first sign of life.</p> <p>Cove and her dive team have been granted permission to explore the Arcadia's rusting hull. Their purpose is straightforward: examine the wreck, film everything, and, if possible, uncover how and why the supposedly unsinkable ship vanished. But the Arcadia has not yet had its fill of death, and something dark and hungry watches from below. With limited oxygen and the ship slowly closing in around them, Cove and her team will have to fight their way free of the unspeakable horror now desperate to claim them.</p>";
