window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>An anthology more than half a century in the making, </b><b><i>The Last Dangerous Visions</i></b><b> is the third and final installment of the legendary science fiction anthology series.</b></p> <p>In 1973 celebrated writer and editor Harlan Ellison announced the third and final volume of his unprecedented anthology series, which began with <i>Dangerous Visions</i> and continued with <i>Again, Dangerous Visions</i>. But for reasons undisclosed, <i>The Last Dangerous Visions</i> was never completed.</p> <p>Now, six years after Ellison’s passing, science fiction’s most famous unpublished book is here. And with it, the heartbreaking true story of the troubled genius behind it.</p> <p>Provocative and controversial, socially conscious and politically charged, wildly imaginative yet deeply grounded, the thirty-two never-before-published stories, essays, and poems in <i>The Last Dangerous Visions</i> stand as a testament to Ellison’s lifelong pursuit of art, uniting a diverse range of science fiction writers both famous and newly minted, including Max Brooks, Edward Bryant, Cecil Castellucci, James S. A. Corey, Howard Fast, Patricia Hodgell, Dan Simmons, Robert Sheckley, Adrian Tchaikovsky, Mildred Downey Broxon, and Cory Doctorow, among others.</p> <p>The historic publication of <i>The Last Dangerous Visions</i> completes the long-awaited final chapter in an incredible literary legacy.</p> <p>The full list of additional narrators includes:</p> <p>Noah Michael Levine, Robin Miles, Jennifer Pickens, Lisa Flanagan, Mark Sanderlin, Robert Fass, Bronson Pinchot, Charlie Albers, Alison McKenna, Natalie Naudus, Tim Campbell, Neil Hellegers, Josh Innerst, Dion Graham, Emily Woo Zeller, J. Michael Straczynski, James Anderson Foster, Feodor Chin, Paul Bellantoni, Marc Vietor, John Pirhalla, Scott Brick, Steven Jay Cohen, Jim Meskimen, P. J. Ochlan, and Gary Bennett.</p> <p><b>PLEASE NOTE: When you purchase this title, the accompanying PDF will be available in your Audible Library along with the audio.</b></p>";
