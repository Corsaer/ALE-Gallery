window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Failed academic Frank Nichols and his wife, Eudora, have arrived in the sleepy Georgia town of Whitbrow, where Frank hopes to write a history of his family's old estate - the Savoyard Plantation - and the horrors that occurred there.

A debt that has been waiting patiently for Frank Nichols' homecoming...</p>";
