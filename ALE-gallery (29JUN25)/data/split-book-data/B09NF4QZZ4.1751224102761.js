window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>In a country torn between left and right, two politicians are about to make history. How? By working together! In a nutshell, that’s the premise of this book.</p> <p><i>House Divided</i> is a political satire, but it’s really a political fantasy, because it takes two opposing candidates, who wouldn’t normally be caught dead together, and challenges them to spend a weekend in the remote Oregon desert - hiking together, camping together, even getting wasted together!</p> <p>Having lived in rural Oregon for over twenty years, I can assure you that the characters presented in this fictional book are almost all based on actual people. In the Oregon backcountry, almost anything goes, so the idea that a “far-right” veteran and a “far-out” hippie might run for the same county commissioner seat is not as absurd as you might think.</p> <p>While this book was not written to solve the country’s political problems, I do think we need to have a laugh at both sides and everything in-between - it’s time to put the <i>party</i> back into politics!</p> <p>I hope you enjoy this book.</p> <p>Regards,<br> Bruce</p>";
