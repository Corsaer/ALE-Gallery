window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>A psychopathic female fugitive provokes a mother's vengeance in this terrifying thriller by the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling author of <i>Gone South</i> and <i>Boy's Life</i>. </p> <p>Back in the 1960s, Mary Terrell shot and killed a man. A former member of the fanatical Storm Front Brigade - a splinter group of the notorious Weathermen - Terrell has stayed one step ahead of the FBI for decades. Living with numerous identities and menial jobs, Terrell's only constants in life have been LSD, psychotic delusions of motherhood, and murderous rage. </p> <p>The '60s are long gone, but Mary is still out there. Now, provoked by a message she reads in <i>Rolling Stone</i>, she's convinced that the surviving leader of her old band of radicals wants to build a life with her. So one night, Mary sneaks into the maternity ward of an Atlanta hospital. </p> <p>Laura Clayborne has a successful career and now a newborn baby. She's the type of person who is sensitive to suffering and injustice. But the kidnapping of her infant son has brought out a white-hot fury. She's not going to sit and wait while the FBI investigates. She's going after Mary herself - headlong and relentless - on a twisting and violent cross-country pursuit to get her child back. But to track a madwoman, Laura will have to think like one.... </p> <p>A Bram Stoker Award winner, this \"expertly constructed novel of suspense and horror\" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>) from the author of <i>Swan Song</i>, <i>Speaks the Nightbird</i>, and other acclaimed works is \"feverishly exciting...a page-whipping thriller\" (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>). </p>";
