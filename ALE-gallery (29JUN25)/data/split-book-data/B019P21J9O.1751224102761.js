With the help of her friend, Jim Gardener, she uncovers an alien spaceship. Though exposure to the Tommyknockers, who piloted the alien ship, has harmful effects on residents' health, the people of Haven develop a talent for creating innovative devices under their increasingly malignant influence. </p> <p>In this riveting, nightmarish story, Stephen King has given us a \"brilliant, riveting, marvelous\" (<i>The Boston Globe</i>) novel. \"You will not be able to put this down\" (<i>Los Angeles Times Book Review</i>).
