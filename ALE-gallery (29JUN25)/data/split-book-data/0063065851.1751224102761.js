window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The Bram Stoker Award-winning author of<i> Survivor Song</i> and <i>The Cabin at the End of the World</i> “slices, dices, and spins the neo-noir in his own strange way” in his “fast, smart, and completely satisfying” (Stewart O’Nan) debut novel featuring a narcoleptic detective from Southie. </p> <p><i>The Little Sleep</i> is Paul Tremblay’s nod to Raymond Chandler starring a PI who nods off. Mark Genevich is a South Boston private detective who happens to have a severe form of narcolepsy, which includes hypnagogic hallucinations, like waking dreams. Unsurprisingly, his practice is not exactly booming.</p> <p>Then one day, the daughter of an ambitious district attorney and a contestant on the reality talent show <i>American Star</i>, named Jennifer Times, comes to him for help - or does she? A man has stolen her fingers, she claims, and she’d like Genevich to get them back. When the PI wakes up from what must surely be a hallucination, the only evidence that his client may have been real is a manila envelope on his desk. </p> <p>Inside are revealing photos of Jennifer. Is Genevich dealing with a blackmailer or an exhibitionist? And where is the mysterious young lady, who hopefully still has her fingers attached? </p> <p>The detective has no choice but to plunge into what proves to be a bad dream of a case, with twists and turns even his subconscious could not anticipate. Chloroforming the hardboiled crime genre then shaking it awake and spinning it around, Paul Tremblay delivers a wholly original, wildly imaginative, gleefully entertaining noir mystery - guaranteed to keep you up all night, even if Mark Genevich won’t be joining you.</p>";
