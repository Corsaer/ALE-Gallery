window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>“Stretch[es] the boundaries of the genre.... It’s horrifying, but there’s beauty.” (</b><b><i>The New York Times</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p><b>“One of the field’s most accomplished short story writers.” (</b><b><i>The Washington Post</i></b><b>) </b></p> <p><b>A gripping collection of six stories of terror - including the novella </b><b><i>The Visible Filth</i></b><b>, the basis for the upcoming major motion picture - by Shirley Jackson Award-winning author Nathan Ballingrud, hailed as a major new voice by Jeff VanderMeer, Paul Tremblay, and Carmen Maria Machado - “one of the most heavyweight horror authors out there” (</b><b><i>The Verge</i></b><b>).</b></p> <p>In his first collection, <i>North American Lake Monsters</i>, Nathan Ballingrud carved out a distinctly singular place in American fiction with his “piercing and merciless” (<i>Toronto Globe and Mail) </i>portrayals of the monsters that haunt our lives - both real and imagined: “What Nathan Ballingrud does in <i>North American Lake Monsters</i> is to reinvigorate the horror tradition” (<i>Los Angeles Review of Books</i>).</p> <p>Now, in <i>Wounds</i>, Ballingrud follows up with an even more confounding, strange, and utterly entrancing collection of six stories, including one new novella. From the eerie dread descending upon a New Orleans dive bartender after a cell phone is left behind in a rollicking bar fight in <i>The Visible Filth</i> to the search for the map of hell in “The Butcher’s Table”, Ballingrud’s beautifully crafted stories are riveting in their quietly terrifying depictions of the murky line between the known and the unknown.</p>";
