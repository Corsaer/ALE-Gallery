window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A mind-bending dramatic production based on the short stories of N. K. Jemisin, the 21st century’s most-honored writer of speculative fiction.</b></p> <p>A barely employed tech worker has never felt they belonged. Not in society, not even in their own family. Their days are filled with loneliness, a struggle to survive and a desperate search for connection—even if that connection is merely virtual.</p> <p>Now, a black-market hacker promises to open a new world for them, and it works—in ways no human has ever experienced.</p> <p>They find a world of wonder, of possibilities and of danger—where their new virtual reality could mean the end of their physical reality. And what they discover could change the fate of humankind—forever.</p> <p><i>Amorph</i> is based on N. K. Jemisin’s short stories “The Trojan Girl” and “Valedictorian,” which were adapted for this Audible Original by Chené Lawson.</p> <p>Available in Dolby Atmos on Audible.</p>";
