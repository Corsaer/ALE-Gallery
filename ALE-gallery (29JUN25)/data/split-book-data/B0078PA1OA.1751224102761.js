Most modern productions employ campiness or sound effects to try to bring back that gothic tension, but we've tried something different. By returning to Stoker's original storytelling structure - a series of letters and journal entries voiced by Jonathan Harker, Dr. Van Helsing, and other characters - with an all-star cast of narrators, we've sought to recapture its originally intended horror and power.</p> <p>This production of <i>Dracula</i> is presented by what is possibly the best assemblage of narrating talent ever for one audiobook: Emmy Award nominees Alan Cumming and Tim Curry plus an all-star cast of Audie award-winners Simon Vance (The Millenium Trilogy), Katherine Kellgren (<i>Pride and Prejudice and Zombies</i>), Susan Duerden (<i>The Tiger’s Wife</i>), John Lee (<i>Supergods</i>) and customer favorites Graeme Malcolm (<i>Skippy Dies</i>), Steven Crossley (The Oxford Time Travel series), Simon Prebble (The Baroque Cycle), James Adams (<i>Letters to a Young Contrarian</i>), Nicola Barber (<i>The Rose Garden</i>), Victor Villar-Hauser (<i>Fun Inc.</i>), and Marc Vietor (<i>1Q84</i>). These stellar narrators have been cast as follows:</p> <p>Alan Cumming as Dr. Seward<br> Simon Vance as Jonathan Harker<br> Katy Kellgren as Mina Murray/Harker<br> Susan Duerden as Lucy Westenra<br> Tim Curry as Van Helsing<br> Graeme Malcolm as Dailygraph correspondent<br> Steven Crossley as Zookeeper’s account and reporter<br> Simon Prebble as Varna<br> James Adams as Patrick Hennessey<br> Nicola Barber as Sister Agatha<br> Victor Villar-Hauser as Arthur Holmwood<br> Marc Vietor as Quincey Morris<br> John Lee as Introductory paragraph, various letters</p>";
