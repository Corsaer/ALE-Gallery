The title track, \"Evil in Me,\" is performed by The Maxines and written by Brom and AJ Grey of The Maxines.</b></p> <p><b><i>Evil in Me </i></b><b>is bestselling author Brom's newest novel of possession, damnation, and rock 'n' roll, where one woman must get the world singing in order to save her soul.</b></p> <p>Aspiring musician Ruby Tucker has had enough of her small rural town and dysfunctional family. But a falling out with her best friend and bandmate has killed her dreams of escaping and making it big in the Atlanta punk scene.</p> <p>While helping her eccentric neighbor organize his religious artifacts, an ancient ring clamps down on her finger—possessing her with the spirit of a blood-thirsty demon. There’s no exorcizing it unless hundreds of people chant a spell to set Ruby free. And what’s worse, the ring is a beacon for evil, drawing an unimaginably wicked mob straight to Ruby, hungry for her flesh. </p> <p>If Ruby can get her band back together, she has a shot at salvation. It's time for her to face the music and put her whole soul into a song—one powerful enough to raise some Hell.</p> <p><b>A Macmillan Audio production from Tor Nightfire.</b></p>";
