window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Director, writer, and actor Jay Chandrasekhar tells the hilarious history of his comedy group, Broken Lizard, and the making of the cult film <i>Super Troopers</i>, as well as the currently filming <i>Super Troopers 2</i>.</b> </p> <p>Jay Chandrasekhar has spent the past two decades writing, directing, and acting in film and TV. With his comedy group, Broken Lizard, he has produced and directed beloved movies such as <i>Super Troopers</i>, <i>Beerfest</i>, and <i>Club Dread</i>. Now, with the coming release of the long-awaited <i>Super Troopers 2</i>, Jay is ready to tell the ridiculous, madcap, dead-honest story of how he built his career, how he formed Broken Lizard, and, ultimately, how he made <i>Super Troopers</i>. </p> <p>Jay grew up Indian American in the lily-white suburbs of Chicago, and he had an outsider's perspective from the beginning. Instead of taking the traditional acting path, he formed his own troop, wrote his own scripts, and made movies his own way. And he had an incredibly good time doing so, as listeners will learn in this hilarious story about making it in Hollywood and making one of the best-loved and most-watched comedies of all time. Part humorous memoir, part film study, this book will inform, entertain, and tell listeners what drinking multiple bottles of maple syrup is <i>really</i> like. </p>";
