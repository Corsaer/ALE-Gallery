window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>“Why run from a haunted house when you can stay and ignore the ghosts? Just when you thought you'd seen everything a haunted house novel could do, <i>The September House</i> comes along and delivers an eerie, darkly funny, and emotionally grounded book about the ghosts that haunt houses and marriages.\"– Grady Hendrix, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>How to Sell a Haunted House</i><b><br> <br> A woman is determined to stay in her dream home even after it becomes a haunted nightmare in this thoroughly enjoyable, twisty, and layered debut novel.</b><br> <br> When Margaret and her husband Hal bought the large Victorian house on Hawthorn Street—for sale at a surprisingly reasonable price—they couldn’t believe they finally had a home of their own. Then they discovered the hauntings. Every September, the walls drip blood. The ghosts of former inhabitants appear, and all of them are terrified of something that lurks in the basement. Most people would flee. <br> <br> Margaret is not most people. <br> <br> Margaret is staying. It’s <i>her</i> house. But after four years Hal can’t take it anymore, and he leaves abruptly. Now, he’s not returning calls, and their daughter Katherine—who knows nothing about the hauntings—arrives, intent on looking for her missing father. To make things worse, September has just begun, and with every attempt Margaret and Katherine make at finding Hal, the hauntings grow more harrowing, because there are some secrets the house needs to keep.</p>";
