window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Book 8 of the Ciaphas Cain series.</p> <p>The Imperium's least willing hero is thrown back into the fight against another alien threat as Commissar Cain returns to a frozen planet to battle an incursion by monstrous orks.</p> <p>Listen to it because....</p> <p>It's a rip-roaring action adventure tale with a few daring twists and a whole load of that typical Ciaphas Cain humour. The opening sequence—involving a dramatic star ship crash—is particularly exciting.</p> <p>The story:</p> <p>Imperial commissar Ciaphas Cain returns to Nusquam Fundumentibus to crush the ork attacks which have been plaguing the frozen planet. But when his ship crashes into the wastelands outside the capital, it disturbs a far greater enemy, one which has lain dormant under the permafrost since long before the Imperium came to this world and could now threaten the whole sector. Faced with ongoing greenskin raids and keeping an over-enthusiastic novice commissar under control, Cain must rally his men and confront whatever emerges from beneath the rapidly melting ice....</p> <p>Written by Sandy Mitchell. Narrated by Stephen Perring, Penelope Rawlins, Emma Gregory, Toby Longworth, Andrew James Spooner. Run time 9 hours and 30 minutes.</p>";
